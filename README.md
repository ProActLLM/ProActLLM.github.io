Proactive Conversational Information Seeking with Large Language Models

**Workshop Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Location:** CIKM 2025 - Coex, Seoul, South Korea

## About

This workshop explores the next step for conversational AI: building proactive information-seeking assistants that go beyond reactive Q&A. We aim to investigate how LLMs can anticipate user needs, model complex context, support mixed-initiative interactions, integrate retrieval and external tools, personalize responses, adapt through feedback, and ensure fairness, transparency, and cognitive grounding.
